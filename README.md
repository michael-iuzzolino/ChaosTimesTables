# Chaos Times Tables

A more detailed explanation will be coming soon. For now, enjoy the beautiful complexity that arises.

In short, you pick a times table you want to visualize, and the visualization iterates sequentially through base-number systems starting from base 2. The base system dictates the equidistant points on the circle's perimeter, and the chord represents the connection between the node number multiplied by the times table and the node number resultant.

Notice that if you pick the 2 times table, then the Cardioid geometry emerges as it does in the case of Z = Z^2 + C in the Mandelbrot set. Similarly, the 3 times table results in a 3-leaf clover, akin to the Mandelbrot set of Z = Z^3 + C. After playing with these, set the times table to a large number and revel in the beautiful cascade of complex geometries that arise.
